## War or Peace

This is the starter repo for the BE Mod1 **War or Peace** project.


2/2 9:24pm : made it through percent_high_ranking in interaction pattern, also complete corresponing test. start on add_card method tomorrow.
2/3 8:30am : fixed high_ranking_cards and percent_high_ranking to work with different deck states/amount of cards in deck. added remove_card method, re-did and completed new tests for everything over.  next: start/finish add_card (beginning is commented out)

2/3 1:42 : fixed high_ranking_cards and percent_high_ranking to work with add_card and remove_card. just need to write tests for them

2/3 2:15pm : finished tests for iteration 1, created files for iteration 2 (player.rb and player_spec.rb)

2/3 4:17pm : finished first part of iteration 2 (player class and player_spec tests) created turn.rb and turn_spec.rb


2/3 8:50pm : finished tests and code up to award_spoils. In morning, first thing to do is write test for award_spoils

2/4 10:52am: finished tests for award_spoils and code. moving to next part of iteration 2

2/4 12:55pm: still working on award_spoils for :war type. only sending 2 cards instead of 6 or whatever. pile_cards method may be culprit.
